// BBB_URL and BBB_SECRET can be obtained
// by running bbb-conf --secret on your BBB server
// refer to Getting Started for more information
let api = bbb.api(
    process.env.BBB_URL, 
    process.env.BBB_SECRET
  )
let http = bbb.http
 
// api module itself is responsible for constructing URLs
let meetingCreateUrl = api.administration.create('My Meeting', '1', {
  duration: 2,
  attendeePW: 'secret',
  moderatorPW: 'supersecret',
})
 
// http method should be used in order to make calls
http(meetingCreateUrl).then((result) => {
  console.log(result)
 
  let moderatorUrl = api.administration.join('moderator', '1', 'supersecret')
  let attendeeUrl = api.administration.join('attendee', '1', 'secret')
  console.log(`Moderator link: ${moderatorUrl}\nAttendee link: ${attendeeUrl}`)

## Tests

To run the test suites some prior configuration is required. First, create a `.env` file in library root. The file should have the following content:

```
BBB_URL=https://mysite.com/bigbluebutton
BBB_SECRET=MySuperSecretSharedToken
```

Make sure, you installed development dependencies ([mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha), and [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)). Now you can run `npm run test`:

```bash
npm run test
```
